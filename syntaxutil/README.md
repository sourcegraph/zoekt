# vendored std regexp/syntax

This package contains a vendored copy of std regexp/syntax. However, it only
contains the code for converting syntax.Regexp into a String. It is the
version of the code at a recent go commit, but with a commit which introduces
a significant performance regression reverted.

At the time of writing regexp.String on go1.22 is taking 40% of CPU at
Sourcegraph. This should return to ~0% with this vendored code.

    cmd/go: replace reflect.DeepEqual with slices.Equal and maps.Equal

    All of these maps and slices are made up of comparable types,
    so we can avoid the overhead of reflection entirely.

    regexp/syntax: use more compact Regexp.String output

    Compact the Regexp.String output. It was only ever intended for debugging,
    but there are at least some uses in the wild where regexps are built up
    using regexp/syntax and then formatted using the String method.
    Compact the output to help that use case. Specifically:

     - Compact 2-element character class ranges: [a-b] -> [ab].
     - Aggregate flags: (?i:A)(?i:B)*(?i:C)|(?i:D)?(?i:E) -> (?i:AB*C|D?E).

    Fixes #57950.
