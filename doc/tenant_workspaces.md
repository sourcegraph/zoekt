# Tenant Enforcement and Workspace Layout in Zoekt

## Overview

Zoekt supports two distinct but related features:

1. **Tenant Enforcement**: Ensures that tenants can only access their own repository data. This is controlled by the `SRC_TENANT_ENFORCEMENT_MODE` environment variable.

2. **Workspace Layout**: Determines how shards are organized on disk based on workspace requirements. This is controlled by the `WORKSPACES_API_URL` environment variable.

Both features affect how shard files are named and organized on disk, but they serve different purposes and can be enabled independently.

## Tenant Enforcement

Tenant enforcement ensures that repositories from different tenants are isolated from each other. 

### Configuration

- Set `SRC_TENANT_ENFORCEMENT_MODE=strict` to enable tenant enforcement.
- Set `SRC_TENANT_ID` to specify the tenant ID.
- Set `SRC_REPO_ID` to specify the repository ID.

When tenant enforcement is enabled, shard file names will include tenant and repository IDs in the format: `{tenant_id}_{repo_id}_v{version}_{shard_number}.zoekt`.

## Workspace Layout

Workspace layout determines how shards are stored on disk, specifically for workspace-enabled instances.

### Configuration

- Set `WORKSPACES_API_URL` to any non-empty value to enable workspace layout.

When workspace layout is enabled, shards will be placed in a `workspaces` subdirectory of the configured index directory.

## Combined Usage

You can enable both tenant enforcement and workspace layout independently. For example:

```sh
# Enable tenant enforcement only
export SRC_TENANT_ENFORCEMENT_MODE=strict
export SRC_TENANT_ID=123
export SRC_REPO_ID=456

# Enable workspace layout only
export WORKSPACES_API_URL=http://workspaces-api

# Enable both
export SRC_TENANT_ENFORCEMENT_MODE=strict
export SRC_TENANT_ID=123
export SRC_REPO_ID=456
export WORKSPACES_API_URL=http://workspaces-api
```

## Migration

If you are migrating from an existing Zoekt deployment, consider the following:

1. Enabling tenant enforcement or workspace layout will not automatically migrate existing shards.
2. For a smooth transition, you should rebuild your index after enabling these features.
3. You may need to adjust your search tools to be aware of the new shard locations.

## Command Line Tools

All Zoekt command line tools (zoekt-index, zoekt-git-index, etc.) respect both tenant enforcement and workspace layout settings via environment variables. 

You no longer need to specify shard prefixes explicitlyâ€”they are determined automatically based on tenant enforcement and repository ID settings.
